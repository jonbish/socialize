## üß† How It Works

Socialize inserts sharing buttons either:

- **Inline** (above your post content)
- **Floating** (fixed to the left or right of content)
- **CTA Box** (customizable section below content)

Each location can display different buttons. All display logic is controlled by global defaults, which you can override per post.

You can also disable sharing or CTA sections entirely for any individual post.
